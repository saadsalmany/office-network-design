# Office Network Infrastructure

A network redesign project which transforms a company network into a secure and segmented network for each department using **VLANs**, **ACLs**, and a **Firewall**.

---

## Problem

This project solves the problem for a business whose internal network is running on a single broadcast domain where access controls and network segregation have not been applied.  
Everybody is connected to the same network, which makes the business's confidential data at risk and allows any user to have unauthorized access over network devices.

---

## Solution

- Create VLANs for each department  
- Apply ACLs  
- Set up Firewall  
- Configure DHCP server  
- Wireless Networking  
- Device Hardening  

---

## Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Draw.io
